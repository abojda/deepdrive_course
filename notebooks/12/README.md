# Quickdraw demo
Simple Gradio demo presenting one of the Quickdraw models from chapter 04 is available in [quickdraw_demo](quickdraw_demo) directory.

# Object detection Gradio demo (+HF Spaces)
I've created another Gradio demo of simple YOLOv5 object detection on custom dataset and published it to HuggingFace Spaces. Demo is available as [HuggingFace Spaces here](https://huggingface.co/spaces/akbojda/aquarium-object-detection).

**I've also wrote a [short article about developing Gradio demo and deploying it to HF Spaces](https://abojda.github.io/aquarium-part3/) on my techncial blog.**
